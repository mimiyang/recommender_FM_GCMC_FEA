## Abstract
Motivated by lack of consideration about the latent factor underlying user-item interactions, researchers
put considerable efforts in studying collaborative filtering methods
that model dependency of distinct users and items. Matrix factorization
is the first attempt to find low-dimensional latent features
of objects. Recent deep learning models for collaborative filtering
recommendation further introduce natural language processing
techniques such as semantic analysis and word embedding to take
advantage of the rich textual information in addition to a raw rating
matrix. In this project, we study and compare three state-of-the-art
collaborative filtering recommender systems including one matrix
factorization approach and two deep learning models. Analysis
and discussion on the experiment results are followed by a brief
conclusion and description about potential extensions.
